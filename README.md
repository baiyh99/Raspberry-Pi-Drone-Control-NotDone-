# Raspberry-Pi-Drone-Control-NotDone-
This project is to control the drone with raspberry pi from scratch. The parts used for the drone including the 
  - frames, 
  - 4x 1000kV brushless motors, 
  - 4x ESCs, 
  - 1xpower distribution board, 
  - 1x double-cell 2200mAh LiPo battery
  - 1x gyroscope
  
 The controlling codes is not done, since the gyroscope is not programmed yet and it is much harder than expected.
 
 
 ESC1 code is supposed to give controls to the basic movements as moving forward, backward, left and right, and takeoff.
 But this code is not the complete one, the complete versoin of this part is still in Raspberry Pi. I will update it ASAP and declare the changes in READ.me.
